# Start
First of all, welcome to computer science! Whether you're planning to make something as advanced as an AI in python, or something as simple as a discord bot, computer science skills are necessary to progress.
As a start, let's try running this file with this specific code in it.
(if you don't have the necessary resources for this step, such as not having IDLE or VS Code, you can check their respective guides)
```py
x = "Hello World!"
print(x)
```
When you run this code, it should result in 
```
Hello World
```
appearing in your terminal. You might be wondering right now, "How does this work, and why does it work in the first place????".
By the end of this guide, you should be able to easily comprehend this type of code, along with more advanced and harder to read types of code in the future.
Now, let's dissect this code to see what it actually does!
