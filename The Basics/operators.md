# Python's Operators
Remember when we covered the "=" sign being an *assignment operator*?
Well, Python has way more than just the "=" operator!
### What is an operator?
An operator in computer science definition, is a symbol or series of symbols (e.g @, #, !) that change or do something to a specific value/name.
For example, let's take the name `x`, and use the `=` operator to assign it to a value:
```py
x = 123
```
This *changes* the name x such that it refers to the value of `123`.
Let's move on to covering Python's operators now.

### Arithmetical Operators
```
*, **, /, //, +, -, % 
```
All these operators cover basic equations that a programmer may need in their day to day programming use.
Let's explain what all these operators even do:
- `*` - The symbol used for multiplying between 2 values. Example usage: `x = 5*3`, Output: `x = 15`
- `**` - The symbol used to represent exponent values, the left value being the base, the right being the power. Example usage: `x = 3**3`, Output: `x = 27`
- `/` - The symbol used for dividing between 2 values. Example usage: `x = 2/5`, Output: `x = 0.4`
